# Ram Notifier
An Ubuntu desktop RAM notifier

Simply run the .dev installer and run the command `ramnotifier` to receive a notification every 60 seconds if your RAM drops below 1000 MB.

## Future improvements
It should be loadable via the search thingy, come with an icon and not require a terminal window to stay open and have an option to set how frequently the check is run and at what limit the RAM is set.
